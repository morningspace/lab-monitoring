* **Native integration with AWS services**: CloudWatch is natively integrated with most of AWS services such as EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, Lambda, etc. They automatically publish detailed metrics in up to 1-minute period.

* **Custom metrics and unified view**: CloudWatch also supports custom metrics with up to 1-second period which is quite good to monitor any sort of custom metrics generated by your applications and services, providing you with a unified view of all your data on a single platform to access, covering AWS resources, as well as applications and services that run on either AWS or on-premises servers (with the help of deploying CloudWatch agent), to gain visibility across your applications, services, and infrastructure.

* **Take automated action on events**: Cloudwatch has features such as handling events and take automated action on them by configuring alarms, e.g., to create backups on schedule or manage auto scaling groups based on criteria you’ve set.

You can run complex query with custom index, get either the raw log data or visualizations via aggregate functions, so as to explore, analyze, and visualize logs instantly, allowing you to troubleshoot operational problems with ease.

* **Anomaly detection using machine learning**: In CloudWatch, you can enable machine learning models to detect anomalous behavior of your metrics.

* **Cross-account and cross-region view**: You can now create CloudWatch dashboards for applications that span across multiple accounts and regions. You can visualize key health and performance metrics, logs and alarms from multiple accounts and regions on a single graph or dashboard.
